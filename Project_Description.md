# Vulnerability Assessment Project - Version 1

The project sets up a vulnerability assessment environment using Docker, comprising OpenVAS (Greenbone Vulnerability Manager) and Metasploitable 2. The main objective is to identify vulnerabilities in a simulated vulnerable environment. The project includes a Docker configuration to facilitate easy deployment and operation of the assessment tools.

## Features of the project:

- **Dockerized Environment**: Utilizes Docker to set up both OpenVAS and Metasploitable 2, ensuring that the environment is portable, reproducible, and isolated from the host system.
- **OpenVAS Integration**: Comprehensive Vulnerability Scanning: OpenVAS, a powerful vulnerability scanning tool, is configured to scan the Metasploitable 2 container.
- **Web Interface Access**: OpenVAS provides a web-based interface accessible through https://your-docker-host-ip:9443 for managing and viewing scan results.
- **Metasploitable 2 Environment**: Simulated Vulnerable System: Metasploitable 2 is a purposefully vulnerable virtual machine designed for testing security tools and demonstrating common vulnerabilities.
- **Network Configuration**: Container Networking: Docker's networking features are used to connect OpenVAS and Metasploitable 2, enabling the scanner to target the vulnerable environment.

## Coding Details:

### Docker Compose Configuration (docker-compose.yml):

This code is a Docker Compose configuration file written in YAML format. It defines the services, ports, volumes, and commands needed to set up and run an environment with OpenVAS and Metasploitable 2 containers. Let's break down each part of the configuration:

#### Version

This specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format. Version 3 is commonly used and supports a wide range of features.

#### Services

The services section defines the individual containers to be run.

**OpenVAS Service**
- `image: mikesplain/openvas`: Specifies the Docker image to use for the OpenVAS container.
- ports: Maps ports on the host to ports on the container.
  - "9443:443": Maps port 443 on the container (HTTPS) to port 9443 on the host.
  - "9492:9392": Maps port 9392 on the container (OpenVAS web interface) to port 9492 on the host.
- volumes: Mounts a Docker volume to persist data.
  - openvas-data:/var/lib/openvas/mgr: Maps the `openvas-data` volume to the directory `/var/lib/openvas/mgr` inside the container, where OpenVAS stores its data.

**Metasploitable Service**
- `image: tleemcjr/metasploitable2`: Specifies the Docker image to use for the Metasploitable 2 container.
- `ports`: Maps ports on the host to ports on the container for various services.
  - `"2222:22"`: Maps port 22 on the container (SSH) to port 2222 on the host.
  - `"80:80"`: Maps port 80 on the container (HTTP) to port 80 on the host.
  - `"443:443"`: Maps port 443 on the container (HTTPS) to port 443 on the host.
  - `"3306:3306"`: Maps port 3306 on the container (MySQL) to port 3306 on the host.
  - `"5900:5900"`: Maps port 5900 on the container (VNC) to port 5900 on the host.
- `command`: Overrides the default command to keep the container running.
  - `/bin/bash -c "while true; do sleep 1000; done"`: Keeps the container running indefinitely by executing a sleep loop.

**Volumes**
- `openvas-data`: Defines a named volume called `openvas-data` that is used to persist data for the OpenVAS container. This ensures that data is not lost when the container is stopped or removed.
